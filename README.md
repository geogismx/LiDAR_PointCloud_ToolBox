# LiDAR_PointCloud_ToolBox
This toolbox uses spatial grid index to organize LIDAR point cloud data, with model builder and Python script building space model, and finally implementing a progressive morphological filtering algorithm for discrete point cloud processing; This toolbox also contains a new topographical feature point extraction method with a combination of hydrology water analysis and TIN geometric analysis.
